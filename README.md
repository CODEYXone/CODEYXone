# Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Codey, also known as CODEYX.

I'm a technology and logistics enthusiast. I love diving into the world of simulations, economic games, and strategic challenges. It's fascinating to explore the intricacies of these virtual environments and see how various factors interact.

### What I do
Apart from playing games, I also have a passion for creating tools and mods for video games. I actively contribute my skills at [@XORA-ONE](https://github.com/XORA-ONE), where I channel most of my efforts into internal projects. It's incredibly fulfilling to tinker with game mechanics, develop new features, and enhance the overall gameplay experience.
